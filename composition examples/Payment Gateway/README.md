Payment Gateway (Strategy Pattern)

Create:

CreditCardPayment â†’ method pay(amount) logs "Paid <amount> via Credit Card".

PaypalPayment â†’ method pay(amount) logs "Paid <amount> via PayPal".

PaymentProcessor â†’ accepts a payment strategy, has processPayment(amount) that delegates to chosen method.

ðŸ‘‰ Concept: Composition for interchangeable strategies.
